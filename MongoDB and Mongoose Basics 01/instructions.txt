This is an Express project using a server with MongoDB database and Mongoose.

The MongoDB database is local and requires the installation of MongoDB and mongosh:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/

Once these are installed, we create and connect to a database called: LearnMongoose01.

We create a Schema in the models folder.
Then in the server file we have two different function to create and save new users.
